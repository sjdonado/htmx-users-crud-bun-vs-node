The main logic is in the `OfferValidationPipe`.

1. Given an input Object, it will recursively search for a valid nested `Offer`.
2. Found an `Offer` type object (pointed by a key: offer, Offer, offers), it will be mapped by provider (separated mappers for each one).
3. If no validationErrors are found, it will be returned as `OfferDTO`.
4. The function returns an array to cover both cases: `[singleOffer]`, `[...multipleOffers]`.
